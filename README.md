# Sentimental-Analysis-using-News-Headlines-of-Stocks
ðŸ“ˆ Sentiment Analysis on Stock Headlines
ðŸ§  Problem:
Retail investors often rely on gut-feel reactions to news headlines, lacking any quantitative sentiment scoring to guide trades. Thereâ€™s also a gap in understanding how news polarity correlates with market behavior.

ðŸ’¡ Solution:
Scraped a corpus of financial news headlines and labeled sentiment using VADER and TextBlob. Plotted sentiment trends across time and correlated with stock prices to analyze lagged or real-time impact. Used seaborn and matplotlib for interactive visualizations and CSV exports.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

NLP: VADER, NLTK, TextBlob

Data Wrangling: pandas, NumPy

Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib

Deployment-ready via Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š Impact:
Created a reusable pipeline for sentiment extraction from finance news. Downloaded and adapted by users building trading bots or dashboards. Great showcase for combining NLP + Finance + Visualization â€” useful in fintech, quant roles, and analyst profiles.
